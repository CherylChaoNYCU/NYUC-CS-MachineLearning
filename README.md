# NYUC-CS-MachineLearning

## HW1.
Implement rLSE,Newton's methon to find the best linear model fitting data points

## HW2. 
HandCraft Naive Bayes classifier
Create a Naive Bayes classifier for each handwritten digit that support discrete and continuous
features.



## HW3.
Baysian Linear regression
Online learning method for implementing predictive distribution

### Note:
1. Discrete Version:

Tally the frequency of the values of each pixel into 32 bins. 
For example, The gray level 0 to 7 should be classified to bin 0, gray level 8 to 15 should be bin 1 

2. Continuous Version:
Use MLE to fit a Gaussian distribution for the value of each pixel(0-256). Perform Naive
Bayes classifier.

### HW4.
1. Logistic Regression using gradient descent, newton's method
2. EM algorithm for unsupervised learning (MINIST classification)
